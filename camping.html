            <h2>Camping</h2>
            <p>So you pack your stuff, you're out and about. You find a nice spot to put up your tent. Before doing so check so you aren't too close to anyones property.<br>
               You should put a respectable distance between you and people living around where you camp, as disturbing is a big no-no!<br>
               Camping in one spot for a couple of days is fine.<br>
               Remember to always leave the campingspot as you found it, littering and destroying the places you visit is not the right way to respect nature or the right of public access!<br>
            </p>
            
            <h3>Some things that you might need:</h3>
            <ul class="campinglist">
                <li>Tent/Hammock</li>
                <li>Sleeping mat</li>
                <li>Sleeping bag</li>
            </ul>
        </div>


        <div class="camping" id="fire">
            <p>Making a <span class="fire">fire</span> is allowed. Bear in mind making the fireplace secure, preventing it from spreading.<br> If there has been a extended time without rain, there might be a ban!<br>
            You can pick up branches that has fallen to the ground and use them.<br> Deadwood that has been on the ground for a long time should be left alone, as it has become a home for insects and plantlife!<br>
            You can check for <span class="fire">fire</span> ban updates<br>

            <h2>My personal experience</h2>
            <p>I free camp all year around! What I sleep in and what equipment I have with me, all depends on the season.<br>
               In spring and summer I use a camping hammock with a mosquito net and a tarp.<br> (when I got my dog I shifted to tent for a while, until she was more comfortable.)<br>
               In autumn and winter I use different tents. In winter I also use an heating stove to keep the warmth up in the tent<br>
               When using the stove I bring firewood with me<br>
               My dog also goes with me on every expedition, in that way I also have extra sharp senses with me!<br>
