# **OUTDOOR LIFE**

This project was started with peoples will and curiosity to visit nature in mind. 
Outdoor life is a big part of my regular life, as such I wanted to highlight some of it!
Centering around a quite unique law called ***the right of public access***. 
Serving as both an introduction to me but also to some of the rights and freedoms of my homecountry of Sweden. 
The hope is to make you invested in visiting and seeing our vast nature for yourself.

### *Content* 

- Correct information about ***the right of public access*** law was taken from The Swedish Tourist Association. Found the details of the law on the swedish language base of the site: [https://www.svenskaturistforeningen.se/guider-tips/allemansratten/?gclid=Cj0KCQiAveebBhD_ARIsAFaAvrG6zILehJirr6DVuSlcCWBU3BGuL2BP6YZL-fdTFovLwLTe7uHNprAaAmpTEALw_wcB].
