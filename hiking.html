    <h2>Hiking</h2>
    <p>A very popular activity in both Sweden and Norway.<br>
       There are countles trails for hiking in Sweden, the most famous is the kings trail.<br>
       It stretches almost a third of the country! Hiking the whole trail is quite a feat.<br>
       It also runs past several nature parks and much untouched nature.<br> 
       One of those parks is Sarek, counted as the last real wilderness area in all of Europe.<br>
       The background image of this website was taken by me, it shows the southern entrance to Sarek<br>
       Swedens geography makes it optimal for hiking as it spans three different climate zones with great variaty of scenery<br>
       The most important thing on a hike in my opinion are good <span id="gear">boots</span> and <span id="gear">socks!</span><br> 
       The video below is a short video I made, showing where we were setting up camp for the comming night, while on an adventure on the kings trail.<br>

        <h2>My personal experience</h2>
        <p>
            I have a love/hate relationship with hiking!<br>
            On the upside I have seen the most beautiful scenery in my whole life whilst hiking.<br>
            On the downside it's taxing on the body and the weight of your backpack makes the difference beetween heaven and hell.<br>
            An example is that I hiked with a backpack weighing around 26-28kg<br> 
            Without training beforehand and no experience hiking long stretches<br>
            It was the most demanding thing i've done in my entire life.<br>
            Almost all of the food I was eating were MRE rations, because it doesn't spoil for a very long time and doesn't weigh much!<br>
            Most people walk from cabin to cabin. You can book rooms in the cabins STF manages while on the larger trails!<br> 
            Most people do that while traveling with light backpacks on around 10-12kg and eating real meals at the cabins.<br>
            I did none of that and slept in a tent, and it was rewarding but a tough experience<br> 
            Especially up the mountains!<br>
            Depending on how you plan your hikes it can be relaxing or highly demanding.<br>
