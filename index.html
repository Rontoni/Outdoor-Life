            <h2>Welcome to nature!</h2>

            <p>
                In recent years the trend of adventuring out in nature has gone up in popularity. Especially in my homecountry of Sweden.<br>
                One of the largest reasons was of course for the more relaxed restrictions under the pandemic which made nature available when many other things were not.<br> 
                The other big reason is that we have a certain law in place called "The Right Of Public Access".<br>
                I myself use much of my sparetime visiting and living in nature recreationally. 
                That's where I come in, this will serve as an introduction for outdoor life in Sweden!
