            <h2>Welcome to nature!</h2>
            <p>In recent years the trend of adventuring out in nature has gone up in popularity. Especially in my homecountry of Sweden.</p>
            <p>I myself use much of my sparetime visiting and living in nature recreationally.</p>
            <p>That's where I and this site come in, this will serve as an introduction for outdoor life in Sweden!</p>

            <h2>The Right Of Public Access</h2>
            <p>This is a law in Sweden that gives you the right to visit most nature areas, privatly owned forests and land!</p>
            <p>As a tourist or a citizen of this country you can ride a bike, paddle canoes/kayaks, pick berries and camp almost wherever you want!</p>
            <p>There are some exceptions and it also needs some common sense when used.</p>
            <p>Things you shouldn't do:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Do not Destroy</li>
                <li>Do not Litter</li>
                <li>Do not Disturb</li>
            </ul>

            <p>I will point out where most of these are applied in the camping and hiking sections</p>
