            <h2>Welcome to nature!</h2>

            <p>
                In recent years the trend of adventuring out in nature has gone up in popularity. Especially in my homecountry of Sweden.<br>
                I myself use much of my sparetime visiting and living in nature recreationally.<br>
                That's where I and this site come in, this will serve as an introduction for outdoor life in Sweden!<br>

            <h2>The Right Of Public Access</h2>
            <p>This is a law in Sweden that gives you the right to visit most nature areas, privatly owned forests and land!<br>
                What does this mean for us?<br> 
                As a tourist or a citizen of this country you can ride a bike, paddle canoes/kayaks, pick berries and camp almost wherever you want!<br>
                There are some exceptions and it also needs some common sense when used.<br>
                Things you shouldn't do: 
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Do not Destroy</li>
                <li>Do not Litter</li>
                <li>Do not Disturb</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I will point out where most of these are applied in the camping and hiking sections!</p>
