            <h2>Welcome to nature!</h2>

            <p>
                In recent years the trend of adventuring out in nature has gone up in popularity. Especially in my homecountry of Sweden.<br>
                I myself use much of my sparetime visiting and living in nature recreationally.<br>
                That's where I and this site comes in, this will serve as an introduction for outdoor life in Sweden!<br>

            <h2>The Right Of Public Access</h2>

            <p>This is a law in Sweden that gives you the right to visit most nature areas, privatly owned forests and land!<br>
                What does this mean for us? 
                As a tourist or a citizen of this country you can ride a bike, paddle canoes/kayaks, pick berries and camp almost wherever you want!<br>
                There are some exceptions and it also needs some common sense when used.<br>
                Things you shouldn't do: 
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Do not Destroy</li>
                <li>Do not Litter</li>
                <li>Do not Disturb</li>
            </ul>
                
             <p>I will point out where most of these are applied in the camping and hiking sections!</p>

            <h3>The Swedish Tourist Association</h3>
            <p>This is a non-profit organization that works to make nature and culture accessible to everyone.</p><br>
            <p>I'm mentioning them because they do excellent work and they are a vital factor for making tourists feel safe and cared for while wandering through the remote regions of Sweden.</p><br>
            <p>If you want more information regarding the organization or too look for more activities, vist their website!<br></p>
